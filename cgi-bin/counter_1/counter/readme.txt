
 Counter, a Scriptol Php program
 =================================

 These files are required:

 The counter is provided as a html page you can cut and past into your home page.

 counter.sol      the page and the display of the counter.
 count.sol        the program that counts visitors.
 counter.val      the file that holds the count.

 Under some Unix servers, sometime you may have to perform: 
       chmod 666 counter.val
 to make the file writable by the counter page.


 To create the counter page, type:
 solp -w counter

 two files are created:
 counter.php
 count.php

 upload the two files and counter.val on your site,
 perform chmod on counter.val is necessary (this depends upon the host).
